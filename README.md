A project that introduces cognitive biases caused by intuition

### Coroutine
    1. Create feature branch according to Branch Naming Rule.
    2. Add -> Commit -> Push your code
    3. Create and merge feature to develop pull request by PR Rule #1
    4. Create and merge develop to main pull request by PR Rule #2
    5. Delete feature branch

### Branch Naming Rule
    1. When the branch for the page is first created,
       create it with feature-(page name)-init
       ex) feature-firstpage-init
    2. In other cases
       It is created as feature-(page name)-function name.
       If the function name consists of two or more words, connect it using underbar(_).
       ex) feature-firstpage-move_car

### PR Rule
    1. When the function is completed in the feature branch and a pull request is performed with develop,
       code review or permission is obtained from other reviewers.
    2. When the work on the page is finished, pull request from develop to main

### Conflict
    1. When a conflict occurs, it is handled in the branch that occurs.
