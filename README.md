### Coroutine
    1. Create branch named develop from main
    2. Create a branch to do functional work from develop
    [3-6] repeat
    3. Add -> Commit -> Push your code
    4. Creating a pull request to develop
    5. Merging a pull request to develop
    6. Delete the feature-branch
    7. If all workers have finished working on the page
    8. Creating a pull request to main
    9. Merging a pull request to main
    10. Synchronize

### Branch naming rule
    1. If the branch to be created is the base for the page, create it with feature-(page name)-init
    2. In other cases, it is created as feature-(page name)-function name.

### PR Rule
    1. When a pull request is made from a branch to develop, the merge is performed at the discretion of the individual.
    2. When a pull request is made from develop to main, the merge is proceeded with the permission of all participants.

### Conflict
    1. When a conflict occurs, it is handled in the branch that occurs.
